<h1>MagSonify</h1>

<p>
  MagSonify is a tool I built in the summer of 2021 as part of a research
  internship.
</p>

<p>
  It allows for the generation of audio which represents the oscillations of
  plasma waves in Earth's magnetosphere, as detected by the THEMIS satellite.
  This conversion, a technique called audification has been innovated as a means
  of getting an overview of large datasets in various scientific fields. When
  the data is presented in such a format, it is possible for us to process it
  intuitively to a degree which is not possible for waveforms rendered on a
  screen.
</p>

<p>
  The main challenge that I worked on was the need to implement various time
  stretching methods during the audification process. These are needed in order
  to make the audio slow enough for the listener to be able to pick up on
  meaningful events. Each time stretching algorithm introduces different
  distortions to the audio, which we wanted to examine.
</p>

<p>
  This work ultimately contributed to a publication in
  <i>Frontiers in Astronomy and Space Science</i>
  and to further work by my supervisor and other collaborators, including a
  planned citizen science project.

<p>
  The research collaboration I was working with ultimately intended to create an
  application which would allow citizen scientists to listen to the audio for a
  given space weather event or time period and would render the accompanying
  waveforms and satellite position. The following videos show a mock of part of
  this interface and exhibit what the audified plasma waves sound like under
  different algorithms.
